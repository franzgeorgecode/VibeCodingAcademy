## Writing Effective Prompts

The key to getting the most out of bolt.new lies in how you communicate with it. A well-crafted prompt is like a detailed blueprint - the clearer it is, the better the result.

### Prompt Structure

1. **Project Overview**
   - Start with a clear, high-level description
   - Specify the type of application
   - Define the main functionality

2. **Technical Requirements**
   - List specific technologies to use
   - Mention any constraints
   - Specify performance requirements

3. **User Interface**
   - Describe the desired layout
   - Specify styling preferences
   - Include any design system requirements

### Best Practices

- Be specific but concise
- Use technical terms correctly
- Break complex requests into smaller parts
- Include examples when possible
- Specify what you don't want

### Example Prompts

‚úÖ Good Prompt:
"Create a React todo app with Tailwind CSS. Include features for adding, completing, and deleting tasks. Use local storage for persistence. The design should be minimal and modern."

‚ùå Bad Prompt:
"Make me a cool app that does stuff with tasks"
